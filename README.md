I'm a 2nd-year B.Tech CSE student at GLA University, passionate about Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence. I'm currently exploring areas like Ethical hacking, network security, and how AI can enhance cyber defence systems. 

I enjoy working on small projects, participating in CTF challenges, and continuously learning from platforms like Coursera and GitHub. I'm actively looking for opportunities to collaborate on projects and take on internships in Cybersecurity and AI.
